# Advanced Breast Cancer Prediction Model

This repository contains an advanced machine learning pipeline for breast cancer prediction using the Sklearn breast cancer dataset.

## Contents

- `Advanced_Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Description

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Feature selection to identify the most important predictors
3. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
4. Training and evaluating multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM)
5. Model comparison and selection of the best performing model

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
